# 🎮 Game of Four

**Game of Four** is a strategic block-placement game developed by a team of 5 as a course project. The objective is to place 4-block pieces on a grid following specific rules — it’s simple to start, but takes real strategy to master!

---

## 🧠 Game Rules

- Pieces must **touch** at least one other piece.
- **Same colors** and **same shapes** cannot be placed next to each other.
- Plan your moves wisely — space runs out faster than you think!
- If you finish your pieces or the other player can't place a piece you win

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- ✅ Custom-built from scratch in Java using **AWT** and **Swing** (yes, we even drew the shapes ourselves!)
- 💾 **Save and Load** functionality so you can resume your last game
- 🎨 **Colorblind accessibility**: customize the piece colors
- 📑 **Fully documented** and followed proper software engineering practices throughout
